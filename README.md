# Cheat-Panel
Panel that is using Auth.gg as it's database

Why am I leaking this?
-
It's because I left coding and I want to give away some of my stuff. In the future I may leak more stuff (C# csgo external cheat, Cyberpunk hacks, league of legends hacks...)

What actually is this?
-
It's a panel for your cheat loader. It has login/register, HWID check, invite code etc. It has pages that are used in different ways (About page, Cheats page, Discord page, Change log page...)

Is it easy to crack?
-
Maybe. I added some security myself in it but I haven't tested it out. If it does work then great and if it doesn't it doesn't take a lot of time to make it work.
